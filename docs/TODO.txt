FRA-MATTEO
  [x] K-Fold evaluation strategy {Fra}
  [ ] reason about the merging strategy for final evaluation
  [ ] variable batch-size 
  [ ] support Keras (generator)
  [ ] we have to be sure that the model weights are the BEST ones
  [ ] consider avoiding gradient exploding (through `clipnorm` optimizer param)


PRIMIANO-LUCIANO
  [ ] adaptive batch-size 
  [ ] split in multiple files
  [ ] create Keras (generator)
